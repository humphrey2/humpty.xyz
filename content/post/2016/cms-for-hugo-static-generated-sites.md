I accidently came across **Forestry.io** yesterday.  It's a CMS for static generated sites.  It looks really smick, but the only way to find out what it's like, is to publish a post with it.  So here we go!

## First Impressions
It's really simple (which is a good thing)... and I was easily able to connect it to my github and aws s3 accounts.

## Site config is easily editable
But should it be?
